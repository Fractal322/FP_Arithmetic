# FP_Arithmetic
This project implements floating-point arithmetic functional unit using SystemVerilog HDL. All RTL units are custom-designed logic modules. Some important modules have separate folders with appropriate testbenches and details. The design can later be synthesized into FPGA-compatible IP cores.
